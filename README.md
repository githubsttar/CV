## Pleasure to meet you...

# Who I Am

Ijeoma Nelson, a happy-go-lucky junior software engineer with a creative spirit. I am looking for a company that values innovative thinking, ideas, hands-on problem-solving in a collaborative environment. The ideal company is where I can strengthen my programming knowledge whilst be able to constantly learn new technologies and new ways of problem-solving.

# A Bit About Me

In 2012, being ever so inquisitive and daring, I decided to take a giant leap of faith and leave my secured road to becoming an architect (against the advice of my dean of school), in favour of pursuing my dreams in tech. I headed to Silicon Valley for an 'entrepreneurial holiday.' Whilst there, I entered a Startup competition and won first prize! This gave me a great platform and afforded me the unique opportunity to meet with some of the Valley's most notorious (sorry! no name dropping) VCS and tech founders.

Determined to capitalise on the buzz which was generating around my concept, I made yet another giant leap -- to extend my holiday from 2 weeks to 3 months and launched my startup in San Francisco. At the time of running my startup, it quickly became clear that my inability to code would impact the delivery of my product, therefore to mitigate against such an event, I began to teach myself to code. I learned enough of Python to create an MVP. The product -- a style aggregator -- proved very popular amongst fashion bloggers and added to the already growing buzz around my concept, but this time on social media. From this moment onwards, I became incredibly fascinated with computer programming.

## Leadership

As president of the student union, I was the head liasion between the staff and student body. Incidentally, my presidentship began at a very turmoultous time in the life of the college, as the new constitution was being implemented to replace the old system. I led my team, through this difficult period and was able to establish a more solid foundation and governance of the student union. In addition to chairing bi-weekly meetings between the principal and my fellow students, I was in charge of communicating the voices and needs of the students to the appropriate members of staff. I began my presidentship with a disengaged and discouraged team who had lost their passion for their position, but through hard work and good leadership skills, I succeded at transforming the student union into a thriving team of enaged and passionate members -- all the while maintaining a 1st / upper 2:1 grade point average. I also learned through this whole process, that I am a people-centered leader. 

## Product Conception and Management

I find that when it comes to releasing a product, it isn't enough to assume that if you build it, they will come. It's important to spend time developing a process which yields value early on. I personally find that the agile method holds many advantages, primarily for the fact that it allows you to quickly test your initial idea, and receive that all important feedback. I employed this lean method of product development during my time running my startup and I found that it allowed my potential userbase the opportunity to contribute to my product, effectively becoming an extension of my team. As a bootstrapping entreprenur, I had to be incredibly creative in the ways I ran my company and one of the key strategies that I developed early on was the idea of building a solid ecosystem of users and developers. Firstly, I evaluated the requirement of each task, secondly I distributed each section to the relevant person and thirdly I showcased the prototype to a selection of users, got their feedback and then repeated the cycle. As well as being a very cost effective method of R&D, I found that this allowed my team to focus on the features deemed important by the users and since my users were bloggers and influencers, their excitement about the product gave me some much needed publicity.
