Who I Am

A happy go-lucky creative spirit who is amazingly curious. In 2012, being ever so inquisitive and daring, I decided to take a giant leap of faith and leave my secured road to becoming an architect (and against the advice of my dean of school), in favour of pursing my dreams in tech. I packed my bags and headed to Silicon Valley for an 'entrepreneurial holiday.' Whilst there, I entered a Startup Weekend competition and won first prize. This gave me a great platform and afforded me the unique opportunity to meet with some of the Valley's most notorious (sorry! no name dropping) VCS and tech founders.

Determined to capitalise on the small buzz which was generating around my concept, I made yet another giant leap -- to extend my holiday from 2 weeks to 3 months and launched my startup in San Francisco. At the time of running my startup, it quickly became clear that my inability to code would impact the delivery of my product, therefore to mitigate against such an event, I embarked upon learning how to code. I learned enough of Python to do some damage and by damage I mean the ability to quickly release a VMVP -- Very Minimum Viable Product. The product -- a style aggregator -- proved very popular amongst fashion bloggers and once again generated some more buzz, but this time on social media. From this moment onwards, I became incredibly fascinated with the idea of building my own products.

I found it especially liberating to be able to take a project from conception to realisation and this feeling of liberation fueled my curiosity for web technologies. As an insatiable learner, I taught myself HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Wordpress Styling and therby pivoting my startup to a career in tech, even to the extent of winning the first web design and development contest I entered. I built a fully responsive website completely from scratch for the German coutrier, Sweetbelly-de. Both teachers and colleagues alike often commend the uniqueness of my creative mind, often remarking on how they like 'the way I think.' Software engineering perfectly compliments my creative and artistic talents and for this reason, I am searching for a place where creativity and experimentation is encouraged -- an environment that sees its value in tomorrow's world.

## Some of the things I'm good at...

Leadership

As president of the student union, I was the head liasion between the staff and student body. Incidentally, my presidentship began at a very turmoultous time in the life of the college, as the new constitution was being implemented to replace the old system. I led my team, through this difficult period and was able to establish a more solid foundation and governance of the student union. In addition to chairing bi-weekly meetings between the principal and my fellow students, I was in charge of communicating the voices and needs of the students to the appropriate members of staff. I began my presidentship with a disengaged and discouraged team who had lost their passion for their position, but through hard work and good leadership skills, I succeded at transforming the student union into a thriving team of enaged and passionate members -- all the while maintaining a 1st / upper 2:1 grade point average. I also learned through this whole process, that I am a people-centered leader. 

Product Conception and Managment

I find that when it comes to releasing a product, it isn't enough to assume that if you build it, they will come. It's important to spend time developing a process which yields value early on. I personally find that the agile method holds many advantages, primarily for the fact that it allows you to quickly test your initial idea, and receive that all important feedback. I employed this lean method of product development during my time running my startup and I found that it allowed my potential userbase the opportunity to contribute to my product, effectively becoming an extension of my team. As a bootstrapping entreprenur, I had to be incredibly creative in the ways I ran my company and one of the key strategies that I developed early on was the idea of building a solid ecosystem of users and developers. Firstly, I evaluated the requirement of each task, secondly I distributed each section to the relevant freelancer and thirdly I showcased the prototype to a selection of users, got their feedback and then repeated the cycle. As well as being a very cost effective method of R&D, I found that this allowed my team to focus on the features deemed important by the users and since my users were bloggers and influencers, their excitement about the product gave me some much needed publicity.
