## Pleasure to meet you...

# Who I Am

Ijeoma Nelson, a happy-go-lucky junior software engineer with a creative spirit. I am looking for a company that values innovative thinking, ideas, hands-on problem-solving in a collaborative environment. The ideal company is where I can strengthen my programming knowledge whilst being able to constantly learn new technologies and new ways of problem-solving.

# A Bit About Me

In 2012, being ever so inquisitive and daring, I decided to take a giant leap of faith and leave my secured road to becoming an architect, in favour of pursuing my dreams in tech. I headed to Silicon Valley for an 'entrepreneurial holiday.' Whilst there, I entered a Startup competition and won first prize! This gave me a great platform and afforded me the unique opportunity to meet with some of the Valley's most notorious (sorry! no name dropping) VCS and tech founders.

In realising that my lack of programming skills would impact the delivery of my product, I began to teach myself to code. I learned enough of Python to create an MVP. The product -- a style aggregator utillising retailer APIs -- proved very popular amongst fashion bloggers, adding to the already growing buzz around my concept, http://www.fashionistasmile.com/2013/06/preshopp-can-you-imagine-world-without.html. From this moment onwards, I became incredibly fascinated with computer programming and as a junior dev, I am interested in joining large organisations because they have an established infactstruture which provides a great platform for me to do what I do best -- deliver innovative ideas using cutting-edge technology.

# Skills

## Communication
During the time I was running my tech startup, I quickly became very familiar with some of the most notorious fashion bloggers and influencers around the world. Though unknown to me at the time that my development process was very agile, my excellent communication skills with the online community of fashion influencers, allowed me to implement the right features in my application whilst getting 'free publicity,' each time the bloggers wrote an article about me and what I was doing. http://www.fashionistasmile.com/2013/06/preshopp-can-you-imagine-world-without.html

## Learning
Having taught myself enough Python and Beautiful Soup to scrape websites and build my MVP, I then proceeded to self learn HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. In fact, the summer of 2016 was spent getting much acquainted with the exercises of Codecademy and the tutorials of Udemy. By September of that same year, I was very much fluent in those technologies and could confidently enter client competitions on Freelancer. I am proud to say that I won the very first competition I entered on Freelancer! My client Sweetbelly, http://sweetbelly.de/, is a German Couterier who wanted a classy and minimal website that would showcase their very expensive creations. I created the site from scratch, using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and PHP for the contact form.

## Leadership
As president of the student union, I was the head liaison between the staff and student body. Incidentally, my presidentship began at a very tumultuous time in the life of the college, as the new constitution was being implemented to replace the old system. I led my team, through this difficult period and was able to establish a more solid foundation and governance of the student union. I succeeded at transforming the student union into a thriving team of engaged and passionate members -- all the while maintaining a 1st / upper 2:1-grade point average. I also learned through this whole process, that I am a people-centred leader.
