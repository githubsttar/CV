Pleasure to meet you...

Who I Am

A happy go-lucky creative spirit who is amazingly curious. In 2012, being ever so inquisitive and daring, I decided to take a giant leap of faith and leave my secured road to becoming an architect (and against the advice of my dean of school), in favour of pursing my dreams in tech. I packed my bags and headed to Silicon Valley for an 'entrepreneurial holiday.' Whilst there, I entered a Startup Weekend competition and won first prize. This gave me a great platform and afforded me the unique opportunity to meet with some of the Valley's most notorious (sorry! no name dropping) VCS and tech founders.

Determined to capitalise on the small buzz which was generating around my concept, I made yet another giant leap -- to extend my holiday from 2 weeks to 3 months and launched my startup in San Francisco. At the time of running my startup, it quickly became clear that my inability to code would impact the delivery of my product, therefore to mitigate against such an event, I embarked upon learning how to code. I learned enough of Python to do some damage and by damage I mean the ability to quickly release a VMVP -- Very Minimum Viable Product. The product -- a style aggregator -- proved very popular amongst fashion bloggers and once again generated some more buzz, but this time on social media. From this moment onwards, I became incredibly fascinated with the idea of building my own products.

Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.
